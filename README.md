# Menu-Based Python Project - AWS Cloud Integration
Welcome to the final project for your summer training and internship! This project demonstrates the power of integrating Python with AWS Cloud services through a series of tasks. Below is an overview of the tasks included in the project.

# AWS Cloud Tasks

1. Launch EC2 Instances

Provision and manage EC2 instances on AWS.

2. RHEL GUI Instance in the Cloud

Deploy a Red Hat Enterprise Linux instance with a GUI on AWS.

3. Access Logs from the Cloud

Retrieve and manage logs directly from AWS Cloud.

4. Event-Driven Architecture

Automate the conversion of audio files to text using AWS Transcribe. Trigger the process by uploading an audio file to S3.

5. Python Integration

Connect Python to AWS service using AWS Lambda.

6. Upload Objects to S3

Seamlessly upload files to the S3 storage service.

7. Lambda and S3 Integration

Automate email notifications by retrieving email IDs from a file stored in S3 using the Boto3 library and sending emails through the SES service.

# Objective

This project showcases the practical application of AWS Cloud services in a Python-driven environment. By the end of this project, youâ€™ll have a fully functional, menu-based application that integrates multiple AWS services, offering both functionality and automation.

# Final Presentation

Prepare to showcase your project, highlighting each of the tasks mentioned above. Ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and ready for deployment.
